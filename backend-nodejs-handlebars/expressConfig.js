module.exports = function(app, express) {
  // Serve static assets from the app folder. This enables things like javascript
  // and stylesheets to be loaded as expected. You would normally use something like
  // nginx for this, but this makes for a simpler demo app to just let express do it.
  //app.use("/", express.static(__dirname +'/app'));
